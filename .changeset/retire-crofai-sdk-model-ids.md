Refresh generated callable model ID constants from the current OpenAPI snapshot.

This removes retired/non-callable constants including CrofAI `greg-1` and `greg-1-super`, older Anthropic Claude aliases, several free Gemma variants, older NVIDIA/Qwen entries, and older xAI Grok entries. It also adds newly callable constants for Anthropic Claude Fable 5, Moonshot Kimi K2.7 Code, Nex AGI Nex N2 Pro, NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra 550B A55B, Stepfun Step 3.7 Flash, and Z.AI GLM 5.2.
