Normalize video inputs and lifecycle handling across xAI, Alibaba Wan and HappyHorse, BytePlus Seedance, Fal, Runway Gen-4.5, Google AI Studio Veo, and Vertex Veo; deliver durable status-change webhooks; and temporarily disable video cancellation. HappyHorse family IDs now route text, first-frame, reference-image, and video-edit requests through the appropriate Alibaba Cloud async model with validated pricing and lifecycle recovery. Runway now uses its mode-specific task endpoints and mandatory API version, Google AI Studio Veo is routable with current pricing, and BytePlus accepts either supported gateway credential name.
